        "The frontend contains a static asset at `frontend/public/assets/video-fallback.jpeg` whose content matches the newly uploaded `image-1.png` (converted/renamed as needed).",
        "When `/assets/watch-our-video.mp4` fails to load, `frontend/src/components/site/VideoSection.tsx` continues to render `<img src=\"/assets/video-fallback.jpeg\" ...>` and the displayed image is the newly uploaded one.",

    "Keep the fallback image URL/path used by `VideoSection` exactly `/assets/video-fallback.jpeg` to avoid breaking existing behavior and documentation.",
