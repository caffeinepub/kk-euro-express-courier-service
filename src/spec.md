# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove all “same day” / “same-day” delivery promises from user-facing frontend copy.

**Planned changes:**
- Update Home page hero paragraph to remove “express same-day delivery” wording and replace with non–same-day language.
- Update Services preview “Express Delivery” card description to remove “Same-day and next-day delivery” phrasing.
- Update Value Props “Lightning Fast” text to remove “same-day and next-day service” phrasing.
- Update Services page “Domestic Courier” description to remove “From same-day to standard shipping” phrasing.
- Run a repo-wide check to ensure no remaining user-facing occurrences of “same day” / “same-day” delivery promises in the relevant frontend pages/components changed.

**User-visible outcome:** The site no longer mentions or promises same-day delivery anywhere in the updated frontend content.
