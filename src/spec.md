# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update site messaging to reflect KK Euro Express shipping across Europe (plus key international destinations) and make “Contact Us” more prominent and consistent.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all user-facing “Punjab” coverage references across existing pages/components with consistent Europe-wide coverage messaging that also explicitly mentions example destinations (UK, USA, Canada, Italy, “and more”) where appropriate.
- Add a prominent “Contact” / “Contact Us” call-to-action in the site header on desktop that links to `/contact`.
- Add a dedicated Contact/Quote CTA section on the Services page linking to `/contact`, without changing any existing contact details.
- Update the Contact page “Contact Information” panel defaults so that when data is unavailable it shows the known business email/phone (eurobanga@gmail.com, 79736-73529) and never placeholder values.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors will see consistent Europe-wide (plus UK/USA/Canada/Italy and more) coverage messaging across the site, have more obvious paths to contact the business (including from the header and Services page), and the Contact page will always display the correct default email/phone when data isn’t loaded.
